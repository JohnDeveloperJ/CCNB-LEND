# Decentralized Liquidity Protocol

A simple decentralized liquidity protocol for showcasing lending and borrowing functionality on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

This repository contains a basic implementation of a decentralized liquidity protocol in Solidity, which allows users to deposit, borrow, and repay funds. It's designed for educational and demonstration purposes and should not be used in a production environment without further development and security auditing.

## Features

- Deposit funds into the liquidity pool.
- Borrow funds against deposited collateral.
- Repay borrowed funds.
- Calculate and apply interest to the total borrowed amount.
- Owner-controlled functions for interest calculation and user liquidation.

## Smart Contract

The core functionality of the protocol is implemented in the `LiquidityProtocol.sol` smart contract. The contract is written in Solidity and is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   gh repo clone JohnDeveloperJ/CCNB-LEND
